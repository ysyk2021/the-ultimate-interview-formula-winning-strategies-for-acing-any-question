The technical interview is designed to assess your proficiency in specific skills related to the position. You might be asked to perform a task or solve a problem to demonstrate your knowledge and abilities.

Panel Interview

The panel interview involves multiple interviewers who will ask you questions and evaluate your responses. This type of interview is often used for higher-level positions or for positions that require collaboration with multiple teams or departments.

Second and Third-Round Interviews
