2. Active Listening

Active listening involves fully engaging with the interviewer's questions and remarks. Pay attention to verbal and non-verbal cues, maintain eye contact, and nod or provide affirmations to show understanding and interest. Avoid interrupting and let the interviewer finish speaking before formulating your response.

3. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

Demonstrate empathy by understanding and acknowledging the interviewer's perspective. Develop your emotional intelligence to recognize emotions in others and respond appropriately. Show genuine interest and curiosity in the conversation, fostering a positive and engaging atmosphere.

Nonverbal communication plays a significant role in interviews. Pay attention to your body language, maintaining an open posture, and displaying confidence through appropriate gestures and facial expressions. Be conscious of your tone of voice, speaking clearly and with enthusiasm to convey your interest and engagement.

5. Paraphrasing and Clarifying

Ensure mutual understanding by paraphrasing and clarifying questions or statements when needed. Restate or summarize what you have understood to confirm that you are on the same page as the interviewer. This demonstrates active listening and helps avoid miscommunication.

6. Asking Probing Questions

Asking thoughtful and probing questions allows you to gather more information and demonstrate your critical thinking skills. When appropriate, seek clarification, ask follow-up questions, or delve deeper into a topic to show your engagement and genuine interest.

7. Pausing and Reflecting
