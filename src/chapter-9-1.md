Find a quiet and well-lit space for your interview. Minimize distractions and ensure that the background is clean and professional. Dress appropriately as you would for an in-person interview to convey professionalism and make a positive impression.

Engage actively with the interviewer by listening attentively and showing genuine interest. Ask thoughtful questions to demonstrate your curiosity and understanding of the role and company. Use verbal cues, such as nodding or affirming statements, to show your engagement and understanding.

Due to potential audio or video limitations, it is crucial to communicate clearly and concisely during phone and video interviews. Avoid rambling or using excessive jargon. Structure your answers in a logical manner and provide specific examples to illustrate your skills and experiences effectively.

8. Follow-Up with Gratitude
---------------------------

After the interview, send a thank-you email to express your appreciation for the opportunity. Personalize the message by referencing specific points from the conversation. This gesture shows your professionalism and leaves a positive impression on the interviewer.
