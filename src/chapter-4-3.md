Leverage professional networking platforms, such as LinkedIn, to connect with current or former employees of the company. Engage in conversations or informational interviews to learn more about their experiences and perspectives on the company culture and values. Their insights can provide valuable firsthand information and help you gauge cultural fit.

4. Attend Company Events or Webinars

If possible, attend company events or webinars to get a sense of the company's culture and values firsthand.

Take note of any shared values or cultural elements highlighted during these events.

5. Analyze the Company's Social Media Presence

Examine the company's social media accounts to gain insights into their culture and values.
