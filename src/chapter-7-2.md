Use active listening skills, such as nodding and maintaining eye contact, to show that you're engaged and interested in the conversation.

Find Common Ground

Find common ground with the interviewer to build rapport and connection. Look for shared interests or experiences, such as hobbies or past work experiences, and use these as opportunities to connect on a personal level.

Avoid discussing controversial or sensitive topics, and focus on finding commonalities that can help you build a positive relationship with the interviewer.
