Staying top-of-mind with hiring managers after the interview is essential for maximizing your chances of landing the job. In this chapter, we'll discuss strategies for staying top-of-mind with hiring managers.

Connect on LinkedIn
-------------------

Connect with the interviewer or hiring manager on LinkedIn to stay in their network and showcase your professional experience and qualifications. Use a personalized message to request the connection, and reference specific points from the interview that stood out to you.

Engage with their content by liking, commenting, or sharing their posts, and use this opportunity to share your own insights or perspectives.

Share Relevant Content
----------------------

Share relevant articles, blog posts, or industry news with the hiring manager or company. This shows your interest and engagement in the field, and positions you as a knowledgeable and proactive candidate.

Avoid oversharing or bombarding the hiring manager with too much information, and consider the relevance and timeliness of the content before sharing.

Provide References
------------------

Provide a list of references to the hiring manager or recruiter, and ensure that they're prepared to speak positively about your qualifications and experience. This reinforces your value and credibility as a candidate, and demonstrates your willingness to go above and beyond in the hiring process.

Ensure that your references are up-to-date and readily available, and let them know that they may be contacted by the hiring manager or recruiter.

Follow Up Regularly
-------------------

Follow up regularly with the hiring manager or recruiter to check-in on the status of the hiring process. Use a polite and professional tone, and avoid being pushy or demanding.

Express your continued interest in the position, and inquire about any updates or next steps in the process. Use these opportunities to reinforce your value and qualifications, and demonstrate your enthusiasm for the role.

In conclusion, staying top-of-mind with hiring managers requires ongoing engagement, communication, and professionalism. By connecting on LinkedIn, sharing relevant content, providing references, and following up regularly, you'll be better equipped to showcase your value and land the job of your dreams.
